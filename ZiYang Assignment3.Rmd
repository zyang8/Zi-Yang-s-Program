Define variables:
i = 1, 2, 3, 4;
xi = units purchased below or equal to 200 in mouth i;
yi = units purchased above 200 in month i;
si = the stock stored at the end of month i;
ai = 1 if units purchased above 200 in month i;

```{r}
library(lpSolveAPI)
Z <- read.lp("ZiYang Assignment3.lp")
Z
solve(Z)
get.objective(Z)
get.constraints(Z)
get.variables(Z)
get.basis(Z)
```

I found there is no need for sensitivity analysis, since we can always get the same answer.
